## UX Analyst & Designer, React Engineer

### Problem

The core business of an insurance company is its ability to track incoming claims, but this insurance company is struggling to collect much valuable information from their current web form.

The existing claim system is outdated, slow, data intensive, and error prone. The process is so painful, users make phone calls to request an admin to enter information on their behalf.

***How can we give the process a face lift and put the intended users back into the playing field?&nbsp;***

### Analysis

Using a Design Thinking Framework, I held discovery workshops with user groups in several business units around the globe to understand current pain points and the data needed for valuable tracking and reporting. Naturally, **there were varying ideologies as to how the current form should be completed and which data points are meaningful between regions**.

I synthesized the information gathered in workshops to draw out several common themes, including a desire for *balance between collecting robust data for analysis and speed to completion*. However, the differences uncovered between regions suggested that a one-size-fits-all solution could be detrimental to data collection, so the solution needed to be somewhat *customizable by region*.

### Design

Moving into the prototyping stage, **I kept regular feedback loops with user groups to capture their reactions and ideas throughout on the design journey**.

The current form had grown over the years with fields added as needed to the end, so I started by mapping out and grouping an optimized field order. This also presented an opportunity to *customize field groups based on regional feedback*.

To improve completion times and accuracy, a vertical field layout was preferable, but there was a need to show more fields at once without hiding under the fold. I opted for a 2-column layout to *maximize space but retain the benefits of a single column, reducing effort needed to read labels and values*.

I modeled smart auto-complete and type-to-select fields to make the form even faster. I took care to mark such fields distinctly so users would remember to check the value before moving on.

### Delivery

I led front-end development on the webform with React and MUI web components. I started by building a light **design system with the company's branding and building in some of the more complex field functions**, like Search and Autocomplete.

I held frequent demos with global users to *observe their interactions with the tools* as it was being built and make small iterations to improve usability.

### Result

With its vertical design, keyboard shortcuts, and auto-complete fields, **the new intake process cut completion times down from a minimum of 10 minutes to as fast as 4 minutes**. The addition of tooltip descriptions on fields and a step progress bar makes onboarding new users easy with minimal training.

Users have an *increased accuracy* as they progress smoothly through the form, and allowing them to return and make changes to previously submitted forms means *even more reliable data is collected.*
