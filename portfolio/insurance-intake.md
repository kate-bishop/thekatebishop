### Problem

The core business of an insurance company is its ability to track incoming claims. The existing web form is outdated, slow, data intensive, and error prone. The process is so painful, users make phone calls to request an admin to enter information on their behalf. How can we give the process a face lift and put the intended users back into the playing field?

### Approach

Using a Design Thinking Framework, I held discovery workshops with user groups in several business units around the globe to understand exactly the data required for tracking and reporting.

I uncovered a need for balance between collecting a robust dataset for analysis and speed to completion. I modeled smart autocompletion on common fields, keyboard shortcuts, and minimal required fields to improve this balance.

Moving into the prototyping stage, I kept regular feedback loops with user groups to capture their reactions and ideas and bring them along on the design journey.

The company's primary users were expected to be on a desktop computer, though the form was designed with mobile and tablets in mind.

I led front-end development on the webform with React (JavaScript) and MUI web components. I started by building a light design system with the company's branding and building in some of the more complex field functions, like Search and Autocomplete.

I held frequest demos with global users to observe their interactions with the tools as it was being built and make small iterations to improve usability.

### Result

The new intake process cuts completion times down from a minimum of 10 minutes to as low as 4 minutes. Users are less prone to errors as they progress through the form, and allowing users to return to previously submitted forms to maek changes means even more data is collected. The form is intuitive enough for most users to begin using with light training.
