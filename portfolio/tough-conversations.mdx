## UX Analyst

### Problem

High school students view standardized test scores as a barrier to collegiate and career success. When test results do not meet expectations, students feel they cannot pursue their dream schools or jobs.

**_How can ACT, Inc. guide students toward meaningful conversations that will keep them motivated to retest or explore other paths to reach their goals?&nbsp;_**

### Analysis

I organized interviews with subject matter experts including students, parents, and counselors to gather sentiments on the college decision process. Students often see the ACT test as a binary “red light/green light” to continue on their projected path to college. I analyzed themes against ACT, Inc.’s existing UX Personas and determined that _the most at-risk students receiving a perceived “red light” score are the Hunters and Gatherers._

**HUNTERS** set their sights on a viable career path and narrowly aim for it, but often have a limited understanding of their individual skills. These students need help to broaden their list of colleges and areas of study by reflecting on their personal interests and strengths.
**GATHERERS** will try out many options, but fail to commit to anything in particular. These students need help to narrow their goals by measuring and comparing their interests.

### Design

By putting the information students have already given the company through its portfolio of cognitive and non-cognitive assessments beyond the ACT, ACT, Inc. has a unique opportunity to provide _continuum reporting tools that enable students to explore their own interests and skills beyond a single-point interaction_ and ultimately guide themselves through the college decision making process.

Before applying to college, there are three major questions Hunters and Gatherers need to answer:

- _What do I want to do?_
- _Where can I do that?_
- _How would I do at that?_

### Delivery

I conceptualized three visual tools to be used in tandem to help answer those three questions in an interactive exploratory manner. In order to encourage students to explore their options, each data visualization accepts input from the student to play out “what if” scenarios and give instant feedback.

#### Major Map

a scatter plot of majors mapped on scales of academic and interest fit. This tool can help answer the _What_.

#### College Recommender

a generator to rank colleges whose student body’s ACT assessment scores are comparable to those of the user. This tool can help answer the _Where_.

#### Success Gauges

measures three probabilities of success in any major, including the student’s likelihood of…

- Earning a “B” average in their first year
- Returning to that major for a second year
- Graduating with that degree in four years

This tool can help give clarity on the _How_.

### Result

I presented my findings to an internal ACT, Inc. audience and published my report on their internal document platform. It furthered a conversation on how the company can _support students in an empathetic manner through difficult stages in their academic careers._

The collection of my research also identified an **opportunity to grow the ACT assessment from a single-point interaction to a high-touch platform** for students to learn actionable insights on their next steps towards higher learning.
